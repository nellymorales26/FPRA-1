*Rising 3rd year*

I am interested in taking this course to learn more about the programming language Python and to explore other ways of how technology can help or impact the field of humanities.

## Data and viz of interest

1. [The Role of Data Science in the Music Industry: Predicting Hit Songs
](https://moldstud.com/articles/p-the-role-of-data-science-in-the-music-industry-predicting-hit-songs#:~:text=Streaming%20platforms%20leverage%20data%20science,markets%2C%20and%20optimize%20marketing%20strategies.)

   This topic relating to data science interests me because it influences the way artists release their songs and how they want to express their art in order to gain more traction and listeners. It not only inspires musicians to mix sounds and experiment with new tools thanks to data science, but it also give listeners improved personalized recommendations than ever before. This can allow listeners to learn about smaller bands and artists whom they might have never heard of before, and support different genres of music they might have had some bias about beforehand.

    I like this graph because I have never seen it before this assignment. I think the overall visualization is interesting and conveys substantial information relative to its purpose. I wonder how the code would look like in order to make this graph, and in what context and information this kind of graph is useful for.

## Ideas from curated datasets & project lists

|Name of Dataset|Brief Description of Data & How Coding Might be Useful|Link to Dataset|
|:--------------|:-----------------------:|:--------------|
|Prisoner records from the Eastern State Penitentiary|This dataset offers the names of some prisoners in the Eastern State Penitentiary. It gives the name and other background information of the prisoners, as well as any comments made during a visit. Coding might be useful to investigate the dataset to show the demographics of the prisoners and to see which crimes were most common.|[Prisoner records from the Eastern State Penitentiary](https://repository.upenn.edu/entities/dataset/9e9c9a7e-c78d-40ba-9541-148b59806870)|
|Predict Students' Dropout and Academic Success|This dataset provides insight as to what determines a student's ability to succeed while in higher education. This then leads to the question of what areas of study are students most likely to drop out in, and, by using this data, how we can identify and prevent these students from doing so. Coding can be useful here to determine the area of study that correlates with high dropout rates, as well as noticing trends among students who have dropped out in the past.| [Predict Student's Droput and Academic Success](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/697/predict+students+dropout+and+academic+success)|
